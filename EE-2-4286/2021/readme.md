# EE-2-4286 Microprocessor Applications

This repository contains course materials for __EE-2-4286 Microprocessor Applications__ provided in Spring 2021 at [Kwangwoon University](http://www.kw.ac.kr/).


## Overview

The microprocessor can be said to be a device that helps to implement the design of digital logic circuits in software. Easily, for example, the PC we use can be seen as a type of microprocessor. The goal of this course is to learn how to design a more complex system with software using the latest embedded PC, Raspberry Pi, based on the knowledge of designing digital logic circuits with hardware. In this course, students learn the structure of the Raspberry Pi and the basics of Python programming, and practice device control, algorithms, interfaces, and communication techniques for various applications in small groups to cultivate microprocessor utility and engineering problem solving skills.

_Prerequisites:_
- Undergraduate-level math (calculus, matrix computation, etc.)
- Basic programming ability in Python 


## Logistics
